As specified entire project is developed using a mvc farmework. As i am more comffortable with python i have proceded with django frame work.
This project uses:
  -Django Framework as a MVC
  -Bootstrap for creating ui elements
  -very little ammount of javascript for popups
  -it uses default database that comes with dajango that is sqllite but it can be easily migrated by adding a postgres-sql engine by adding following:
    -‘default’: {

        ‘ENGINE’: ‘django.db.backends.postgresql’,

        ‘NAME’: ‘myproject’,

        ‘USER’: ‘myuser,

        ‘PASSWORD’ : ‘mypassword’,

        ‘HOST’ : ‘localhost’,

        ‘PORT’ : ‘5432’

    } by changing default dbsqllite to postgresql
